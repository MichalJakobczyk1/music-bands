# My Favourite Music Bands

I built up this project to do something spotify like, of course as a very minimized version, but my main goal was to try js carousel on my own and work with my favourite music in the background.

## Explore,download and listen!

My project is supported by PWA so if you like the same music as me you can download it right on your phone!
